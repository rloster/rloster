- 👋 Hi, I’m Rhiannon Loster, a Masters of Mathematics with a collaborative specialization in One Health student at the University of Guelph.
- 👀 I’m interested in modelling diseases spread and dynamics, and how changes in public compliance affects the spread.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Bayesian techniques to properly represent the uncertainty in models. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on modelling or epidemiology research in public compliance and spread/dynamics of diseases like COVID-19, influenza, Lyme disease, etc.
